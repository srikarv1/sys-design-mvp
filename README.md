# System Design Simulator

A drag-and-drop system design simulator for interview preparation. Build, simulate, and learn system design patterns through interactive challenges.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Learning
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Build system designs by dragging components onto the canvas
- **Real-time Simulation**: See metrics change as you add/remove components
- **Instant Feedback**: Get immediate scores and recommendations

### ðŸ§© Component Library
- **API Gateway**: Entry point with rate limiting and routing
- **Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution across instances
- **Web Applications**: Business logic servers with configurable replicas
- **Databases**: Primary and read replicas with availability calculations
- **Caching**: Redis-style in-memory cache with TTL support
- **Object Storage**: S3-style storage for files and large data
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous processing and decoupling
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch-style full-text search
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for static assets

### ðŸ“Š Metrics & Scoring
- **Latency Analysis**: P50, P95, P99 latency calculations
- **Availability**: System reliability based on component configurations
- **Cost Optimization**: Monthly infrastructure cost tracking
- **Throughput**: Request handling capacity analysis
- **SLA Compliance**: Automatic checking against challenge requirements

### ðŸŽ® Challenge System
- **Progressive Levels**: From beginner to expert challenges
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Image sharing, social feeds, e-commerce platforms
- **Requirements Tracking**: Must-have components and anti-pattern detection
- **Hints & Guidance**: Contextual help for each challenge

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
